I've known my friend Hamish for many years, and we've had a common interest in technology and other such things. He was one of the first people to encourage me to get into programming in the first place, and he's been a mentor of sorts to me ever since.

Even though he has moved out West, and lives in Chilliwack, BC with his wife and kids, we've kept in touch. We've had semi-regular video chats where we catch up and talk about what's new. A couple weeks ago, he had the idea, "why don't we just record it?"

So... yeah.

We tried it out. We talked about things we found cool, and things that might be helpful. We were rather disorganized. We ended up talking for over two hours. As usual, we enjoyed our little chat. And you know what? There's a chance you might enjoy it too.

In the future, we'll cut it off at one hour, we'll be slightly more organized (only slightly), and we'll try to increase the quality of the sound.

If you do decide to take a peak, please let us know! And if you have comments and/or suggestions, please *definitely* let us know!
